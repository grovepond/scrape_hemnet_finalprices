This is a simple tool to scrape information about final prices from the Swedish estate broker web "Hemnet". 
Arguments -u URL -o OUTPUT
URL needs to be pointing to a search in hemnet.se for a final prices section. 
OUTPUT is the csv file where the results are stored. 

The broker names will be broken due to a strange behaviour in the site itself.
